# ABOUT ME
  
My name is Christian John S. Calma, and I am 20 years old. I am currently taking up Industrial Engineering at Technological Institute of the Philippines (QC). As a student, I am interested in learning more about my field and developing skills that will help me in the future. I enjoy travelling, biking, and sleeping, which helps me relax and stay motivated. I consider myself curious, and I like meeting new people and gaining new experiences. Through my studies and interests, I hope to grow both personally and academically and achieve my goals.
